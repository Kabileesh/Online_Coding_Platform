# Online Coding Platform

Web Application build using the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack. It offers a sandbox environment, ensuring the safe execution of user code in different languages. The user can also save the result of the executed code for future reference.

## Features

* ### User Authentication :

  Encryption is implemented using hasing libraries for user data securities.
* ### Session Handling:
  Stateless session handling is implemented using JWT Token.
* ### Secure SandBox runtime environment:
  The platform utilizes Docker runtime to create a secure, isolated environment for executing user code, preventing any interference with the hosting system.
* ### Code Execution and Result Storage:
  Users can execute their code and view the results in real-time. The platform also provides the functionality to save the executed code and results for future reference.
